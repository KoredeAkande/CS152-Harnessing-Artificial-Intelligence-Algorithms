# CS152-Harnessing-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms

Overview
------------
Select coding assignments and exercises from the CS152: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Algorithms class, taken in Fall 2020. The course covered and honed in an a range of AI and python skills including propositional logic, logic programming, predicate calculus, computational reasoning, object-oriented programming, and data structures and algorithms.

Topics addressed include search algorithms (both naive and informed), logical deduction and resolution, conjunctive normal form, DPLL, forward and backward chaining, to name a few. 

Final Project Discussion
------------
The course culminated in a self-selected final project where I build an (interactive) Connect 4 Human vs. AI game. The AI player is implemented using the [minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning#Improvements_over_native_minimax), thus reducing the effective search tree depth. A brief dummy run/gameplay from the project is shown below. The full project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/KoredeAkande/CS152-Harnessing-Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms/blob/main/Final%20Project:%20Interactive%20Connect%204%20Game/Pygame%20Connect%204%20Implementation.ipynb) as well as its accompanying report.
