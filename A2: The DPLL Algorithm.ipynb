    "In this assignment, you are required to implement the DPLL algorithm in python as described in Figure 7.17 in Russell & Norvig, and demonstrate it on a given KB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "This assignment consists of several parts that should be completed in python code. You may use a\n",
    "python notebook with markdown cells for documentation, or a python script with substantial commenting to explain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a python class Literal, which will be used to represent a logical literal. This class\n",
    "should contain a name attribute, which is a string containing the name of the literal. In addition, since clauses in DPLL may include negated literals, the class should also have a sign\n",
    "attribute, which is True if the literal is positive and False if the literal is negative. The class\n",
    "should also overload the `__neg__(self,other)` method to allow negative literals to be defined in clauses. As an example, the class should allow us to define literals like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - A = Literal(A)\n",
    "    - B = Literal(B)\n",
    "    - C = Literal(C)\n",
    "    - D = Literal(D)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   which will then allow us to define a KB in CNF comprising clauses by a list of sets. For example, if we wish to represent the knowledge base given by the CNF\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$(A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ ¬C) ∧ (¬A ∨ B ∨ D),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   we would write the python code\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   KB = [{A,B},{A,-C},{-A,B,D}]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Each set indicates a disjunction of the literals contained within it, with the negative sign indicating a negated literal.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Implement a simplified version of the DPLL algorithm as in Figure 7.17, excluding the pure symbol and unit clause heuristics. This essentially reduces to choosing an arbitrary unassigned literal and trying to assign both true and false values to it and performing recursive evaluation of DPLL. You should have a function that is callable using the signature\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   (satisfiable, model) = DPLLSatisfiable(KB)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   where KB is the knowledge base as above. This contains an additional output to the specification in Russell & Norvig. The outputs are satisfiable - a boolean value indicating whether or not the KB is satisfiable, and model - a python dictionary that has a Literal as the key and the value being one of the strings ‘true’, ‘false’ or ‘free’, depending on whether the literal must be true or false or can be freely chosen to ensure satisfiability. Remember that this function only has to return one model that works (even though there may be several). An example output for the KB above would be\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   model = {A: true, B: true, C: false, D: free}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Note that in this case, the literal A could also be free, but depending on the DPLL trace, A may be assigned in a model. The free variables will in practice be those symbols left over after DPLL has run to completion.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Test your code on the KB given in Exercise 7.20 of Russell & Norvig. Convert the KB into CNF and then run DPLL to determine a model for the KB and print it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions\n",
    "1. Instead of choosing a symbol to assign arbitrarily, choose the one that is yet to be assigned\n",
    "and occurs in the most number of clauses at each point in the algorithm (known as the degree\n",
    "heuristic)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement the pure symbol and unit clause heuristics, which are the primary innovations of\n",
    "DPLL over a simple recursive depth-first enumeration over true-false values. Extra kudos\n",
    "will be given for choosing the pure symbol that occurs the most over all clauses each time\n",
    "rather than choosing one arbitrarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "1. You can assume that a literal can occur at most once in every clause, either non-negated or\n",
    "negated. Two literals of the same sign in the one clause would cancel out and reduce to a\n",
    "single literal $(A ∨ A = A)$, and two literals of opposing signs will make the clause trivially\n",
    "true i.e. $(A ∨ ¬A = true)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A clause is true as soon as any of its literals are true, and a clause with any literals false can\n",
    "be replaced by a clause with those literals removed. The only way to falsify a clause is if all\n",
    "literals (taking signs into account) are false.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You may wish to put literals into a set regardless of their sign and not treat two literals with\n",
    "the same name, but different signs, as distinct. In this case, you can overload the equality\n",
    "operator `__eq__(self,other)` in order to specify that two literals are equal regardless of their\n",
    "sign (i.e. based only on their names). An alternative would be to use two sets for each clause,\n",
    "one storing the positive literals and one storing the negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You may find it useful to define literals ‘true’ and ‘false’, and use these to indicate whether\n",
    "a clause is true in a given model or has been falsified. Additionally, at the execution point where all of the clauses are true, you could save the model using a global variable, that you\n",
    "can read once the DPLL recursion has terminated."
